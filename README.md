# Osu-Picture-Maker
Creates custom images based on your cursor movement in Osu! 

In the main file (version2) you will see #'d writings, those explain what each component does in their respective lines/following sections. 
Main points you have to change are 3 sections; 

At the start of the code, implement your screen size and osu play size (both are commented so you will know which line exactly). 

In the minute/second section put the number of minute and seconds shown in the osu beatmap section. 

At the end of the program you will see "Picture Name", change that name to your currently playing osu beatmap name. KEEP THE .JPG at the end. 

ps: I will be adding and pretty looking images into this directory. 

Have fun! 
Ask me if you want to know more of have any issues with the program, I am happy to help ^-^
